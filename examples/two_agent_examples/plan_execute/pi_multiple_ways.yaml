  * TITLE: Calculate Pi multiple ways

  Your task is to create and test at least 5 different ways of calculating Pi in Python.
  For each method, run your test and save data files (e.g. JSON, CSV, your choice)
  related to convergence tests for that method.  The final output should be a web page
  with a short explanation of each method, an evaluation of which got closer to the
  correct value for Pi, and a single plot which shows all results with the calculated
  value for Pi on the y-axis, x-axis will be the number of steps taken in that 
  method to get that result.

  CONSTRAINTS:
    * Plots should be attractive, colorful (e.g. each method a different color), and
      created using Seaborn plotting library.
    * No method should be allowed to for more than 5 minutes max.
    * Before running any methods, but after deciding what 5 methods you will use,
      you must hypothesize and save to hypothesis.txt a brief description of your
      hypothesis which method will perform the best.
    * While we discuss the x-axis being the number of steps, obviously different
      methods may take more/less time to take a step.  You must save that information
      as well and produce a bar chart which presents the time/step for each
      method.
    * The line plot should include a dashed, black line at the known value for Pi
      via numpy.
    * Web page must present the 2 plots, a discussion of each method, the hypothesis,
      and an analysis of results (e.g. whether you validated or refuted your
      hypothesis).
