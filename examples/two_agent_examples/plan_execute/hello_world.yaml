# omit if not needed
# this is where you might link in a local dataset you want the agents
# to have access to, or a program (simulation, executable, etc) or
# libraries you have locally that you want the agent to use.
# to be clear, you'd then tell the agent (below) that it has
# access to the files you describe in 'dest' in the symlink
# below.

#  source: ./some-destination-directory

# this task is easy enough that you should consider running it with a low
# quality / fast model like o3-mini
# this demo isn't intended to give you really high quality results, but
# o3-mini doesn't always work for agentic tasks like URSA, so don't be 
# surprised if you need to pick a slower, higher quality model - these
# things are stochastic after all :).

  * TITLE: Hello World 

  Your task is to write a Python hello world file.  

  You are to use the Rich console functionality to write out a Hello World
  example.  It should (1) demonstrate some features of Rich (at least several,
  including colors), (2) include at least 1 emoji (bonus points for more, if
  you can make them relevant), and (3) include some sort of ASCII art.
  Finally (4) include some sort of meme or humor into this, at your
  discretion.  Dealer's Choice!

  CONSTRAINTS:
     * There should be a single hello_world.py file created and modified
       if necessary.
     * You must run hello_world.py, which will display to the user.
     * Do not install any additional packages.
     * Do not use git for any reason.
     * Make sure you make it colorful and fun!
