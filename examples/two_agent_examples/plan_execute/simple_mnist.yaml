# to have access to, or a program (simulation, executable, etc) or
# libraries you have locally that you want the agent to use.
# to be clear, you'd then tell the agent (below) that it has
# access to the files you describe in 'dest' in the symlink

  TITLE: MNIST Simple Project

  Organize the project like this: 
  project/
    data/               
    src/             
    outputs/
      figures/      
      tables/      
    models/        
    README.md     
  Task 1:
    * Get the MNIST dataset
    * Perform some basic EDA, save EDA plots in the 'figures' directory
  Task 2:
    * Create a train/validate/test split dataset and store the data in
      the 'data' directory
  Task 3:
    * Build a simple linear regression model as a baseline
    * Fit the model and save results in 'outputs/tables' directory as a CSV
  Task 4:
    * Implement a tiny CNN for this dataset
    * Build a dataloader based on earlier task for train/val/test split
    * Train the model, logging train/val loss and accuracy in 'outputs/tables'
    * Generate plots for loss and accuracy, save to 'figures'
    * Save the model as a '.pth' in 'models' dir
  Task 5:
    This task is about test and evaluation
    * Generate a confusion matrix and save in 'figures'
    * Show a grid of 32 misclassifications with (true,pred) pairs
  Task 6:
    * Write a summary report in '.tex', compile it into a PDF with 'xelatex'
    * Make sure the report includes some of the figures
    * Create the 'README.md' to explain the project, how to reproduce the
      results, etc.
